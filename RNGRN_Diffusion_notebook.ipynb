    "    J - k^2 D.\n",
    "    $$\n",

    "    If, for some nonzero \\(k\\), this matrix has an eigenvalue with positive real part, then the system will be unstable with diffusion. This is true when: \n",

However when the differential diffusivity is changed to 0.1 (10-fold difference in diffusion coefficient), this Turing volume becomes tiny, demonstrating the importance of differential diffusivity in Turing pattern formation.\n",
